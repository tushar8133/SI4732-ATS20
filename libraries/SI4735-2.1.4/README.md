|----------|------------|
|  ![SI4735 Prototypes](extras/images/multiplatform_SI47XX_photo_05.png)  | This document is aimed at the Arduino developers, radio experimenters, hobbyists and anyone interested in building a receiver based on the Si473X IC family from Silicon Labs.  This project is about an Arduino library for the SI473X BROADCAST AM, SSB and FM/RDS RADIO RECEIVERS. Actually, AM and SSB modes from 150kHz to 30MHz; and FM mode from 64 to 108 MHz.


<BR>

This library is intended to provide an easier interface for controlling the SI47XX (including the boards ["PL102BA-S V:2.1 10628"](https://pu2clr.github.io/SI4735/extras/BOARD_PL102BA/) and ["NE928-10A V:01"](https://pu2clr.github.io/SI4735/extras/BOARD_NE928_10A_V_01/) based on SI4730) by using Arduino platform. [It also has support to the SSB mode on SI4735-D60 and SI4732-A10 devices](https://pu2clr.github.io/SI4735/#si4735-patch-support-for-single-side-band). __The communication protocol used by this library is the I²C__. 

This library was built based on ["AN332 Si47XX PROGRAMMING GUIDE REV 1.0"](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/application-notes/AN332.pdf) and __AN332 REV 0.8 UNIVERSAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE AMENDMENT FOR SI4735-D60/SI4732-A10 SSB AND NBFM PATCHES__. It also can be used on __all members of the SI473X family__ respecting, of course, the features available in each IC version. Please, follow the [contents below](https://pu2clr.github.io/SI4735/#contents) to get the most out of this document. 

This library can be freely distributed using the MIT Free Software model.

## Attention
* __The SI473X device can work from 1.6V to 3.6V. If you are not using a 3.3V version of Arduino, you have to use a kind of 5V to 3.3V bidirectional converter. It is important to say that just power the Si47XX device with 3.3V from Arduino board is not enough. You have to be aware that the Arduino that operates with 5V, the digital pins and the I2C bus will send 5V signals to the SI473X device. That configuration can make the system unstable or damage the Si473X device__.  
* __This library has been successfully tested on many boards including:  ESP32; STM32; Mega 2560;  DUE; ATmega328 and Atmega32u4 based boards; ATtiny85 and more__. See [Boards where this library has been successfully tested](https://pu2clr.github.io/SI4735/#boards-where-this-library-has-been-successfully-tested).  
* __The Si47XX IC family  functionalities__ can be seen in the comparison matrix shown in table 1 (__Product Family Function__); pages 2 and 3 of the [“Si47XX PROGRAMMING GUIDE; AN332 (REV 1.0)”](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/application-notes/AN332.pdf).




## SI4735 Library construction history

I started my work on building an Arduino library for SI375 in early November 2019. The initial idea was to build a receiver by using an Arduino board, few components and the SI4735 device from Silicon Labs. Checking some videos on Youtube, I realized that the receiver besed on Si4735-D60 could go far beyond the initial proposal, __including listening to amateur radio and citizens band stations on SSB mode__. Via forums and websites, I also realized that there was a great demand for experimenters who would like to see the SI4735 device working on SSB mode. So, instead of developing a simple receiver based on the SI4735, __I decided to develop a library for Arduino platform that would provide full support to the SI4735 and all SI473X device family as well__.

With this library, more than 30 examples were developed using various display types. [These examples can assist the experimenter in building their own receiver](https://github.com/pu2clr/SI4735/tree/master/examples).

Judging by the groups created around the SI47XX devices, I estimate that this library is currently being used by hundreds of experimenters. If you are an experimenter or a radio enthusiast and want to try the SI473X devices, then this library is for you.  

The following video is a little joke that shows the trajectory of the construction of this library. __"PU2CLR SI4735 Arduino Library. IT IS OPEN SOURCE IT IS FREE. IT IS FOR YOU"__.

## About the SI4732 and SI4735  

The SI4732-A10 and SI4735-D60 are DSP radio receivers IC from Silcon Labs. They have great performance on AM, SSB (LW/MW/SW) from 150kHz to 30MHz and  FM (VHF) from 64 to 108 MHz. __It is important to note that the engineers and programmers at Silicon Labs did an excellent job by implementing all the internal resources in this IC family. This library implements just the interface  that allows you to use the SI473X resources with  Arduino based board controller__. 
The SI473X can be programmed by sending commands and getting responses. You can control it via a microcontroller like Arduino using  I²C  communication protocol. To make the SI473X perform an action, the microcontroller has to send a set of bytes (command and arguments) that the device interprets and executes the given command. The  image below illustrates the interaction between the MCU and the SI473X device.

### Interaction between Arduino based board and SI473X devices via  I²C  interface

![SI473x Block Diagram](extras/images/I2C_MCU_SI473X.png)


<BR>

### Functional Block Diagram

The image below shows the SI473X-D60 block diagram. It was extracted from Silicon Labs Si4730/31/34/35-D60 / BROADCAST AM/FM/SW/LW RADIO RECEIVER (page 21). __Note that the author of this Library highlights in red the pin operating voltages that can be connected to the Arduino__. Be aware of the operating voltage of the Arduino pins you will use in your project. Preferably use an Arduino with 3.3V operating voltage. If you are not using a 3.3V version of Arduino, you must use a kind of 5V to 3.3V converter on RST, SCLK, SDIO and SEN (depending on your project). 


![SI473x Block Diagram](extras/images/block_diagram.png)


According to the Si47XX PROGRAMMING GUIDE/AN332, the Si4732-A10 has the same firmware FMRX component and AM_SW_LW RX component as that of Si4735-D60. It is considered as the most recent revision as D60. So, __All descriptions related to the SI4735-D60 also apply to Si4732-A10__. __Including SSB patch support__. See the Si4732-A10 block diagram below.  


![SI4732-A10 Block Diagram](extras/images/si4732_A10_diagram.png)


#### SI4735-D60 and SI4732-A10 I²C bus address 

While the Si4735-D60 provides the 0x11 I²C bus address when the SEN pin is connected to the ground and the SI4732-A10 provides the same address when the SEN pin is connected to the +VCC.  Also, this library provides the function __getDeviceI2CAddress__ to detect the I²C bus address automatically. This way, you don't need to worry about this setup if you use this function. See [getDeviceI2CAddress()](https://pu2clr.github.io/SI4735/extras/apidoc/html/group__group05.html#ga668008457910e916ebadf15bda2e5b29).

### Defined Data Types and Structures

The Si47XX family works with many internal data that can be represented by data structure or defined data type in C/C++. These C/C++ resources have been used widely here. This approach made the library easier to build and maintain. Each data structure created here has its reference (name of the document and page on which it was based). In other words, to make the SI47XX device easier to deal with, some defined data types were created to handle  byte and bits to process  commands, properties and responses. __The goal of this approach is separating data from code__. 

All data types defined in Si4735 Arduino Library are explained [here](https://pu2clr.github.io/SI4735/extras/apidoc/html/)

### Public methods 

This library was developed using the C++ language and the Object-oriented Programming approach. Methods are functions that belong to the class, in this case SI4735 class. Click [here](https://pu2clr.github.io/SI4735/extras/apidoc/html/group__group01.html) to go to API docummentation.

All methods defined in Si4735 class are explained [here](https://pu2clr.github.io/SI4735/extras/apidoc/html/). The list below refer to the method groups implemented by the Si4735 class.   


#### Si47XX device setup and startup

Methods of this group are useful to configure the way that the Si47XX devices have to be initiate. 


#### Firmware Information

Allows to query the part number, chip revision, firmware revision, patch revision and component revision numbers.

#### Current Status 

The Si4735 class has a set of methods to query the current frequency, RSSI, SNR, multipath, and the antenna tuning capacitance value (0-191).

#### Current AGC Status

Methods to query AGC status.  Returns whether the AGC is enabled or disabled and it returns the gain index. 


#### Si4735 filters configuration

The SI4735 class has a set of methods to setup filters on AM and SSB mode.

#### Audio 

Methods to setup the audio mode (Digital or Analog), volume, mute etc. 

### RDS

This library implements some RDS features of the SI4735. All function to deal with RDS are documented [here](https://pu2clr.github.io/SI4735/extras/apidoc/html/group__group16.html). Below you have some videos showing the RDS functionalities implemented by the PU2CLR Si4735 Arduino Library.

{% include videoRDS2.html %}


{% include videoRDS1.html %} 


See [RDS example implementations for more details](https://github.com/pu2clr/SI4735/tree/master/examples/SI47XX_10_RDS).


### SI4735 Patch Support for Single Side Band

The SI4735 class implements a set of methods to apply patches and deal with SSB mode. All API documentation about pathces can be seen [here](https://pu2clr.github.io/SI4735/extras/apidoc/html/group__group17.html).

The SSB patches used in some examples of this library were tested only on SI4735-D60 and SI4732-A10 devices.  __The updates used in that examples are unlikely to work on other SI47XX devices__.

__First of all, it is important to say that the SSB patch content is not part of this library__. The patches used with test purpose here were made available by Mr. [Vadim Afonkin](https://youtu.be/fgjPGnTAVgM) on his [Dropbox repository](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/xzofrl8rfaaqh59/AAA5au2_CVdi50NBtt0IivyIa?dl=0). Also, on Silcon Labs website, [support and community](https://www.silabs.com/community/audio-radio/forum.topic.20.10.html/ssb_and_or_ask_fskn-nJpo), there is a topic called "__SSB and/or ASK/FSK/nPSK demodulation on Si radio chips__". If you follow that topic, you will see a post from a member called "__DASM__" making available a [link to a patch](https://www.silabs.com/content/usergenerated/asi/cloud/attachments/siliconlabs/en/community/groups/audio-radio/forum/jcr:content/content/primary/qna/ssb_and_or_ask_fskn-nJpo/lookattachment_p216-Fwrr/si4735_patch.txt) for the SI4735-D60 and SI4732-A10. The structure of this file is a bit different if compared with Vadim's files __amrx_6_0_1_ssbrx_patch_full_0x9D29.csg__ and __amrx_6_0_1_ssbrx_patch_init_0xA902.csg__. However, they have the same idea and can be easily adjusted for patching. If you have some experience with C, all you have to do is following the recommendations of the SI47XX PROGRAMMING GUIDE AN332; page 219.

IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE AUTHOR OF THIS LIBRARY DOES NOT ENCOURAGE ANYONE TO USE THE SSB PATCHES CONTENT FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES. __IN OTHER WORDS, THIS LIBRARY ONLY SUPPORTS SSB PATCHES, THE PATCHES THEMSELVES ARE NOT PART OF THIS LIBRARY__.

#### What does SSB patch means?

In this context, a patch is a piece of software used to change the behavior of the SI4735-D60 and SI4732-A10 device.

There is little information available about patching the SI4735-D60 and SI4732-A10. The following information is the understanding of the author of this project and it is not necessarily correct.

A patch is executed internally (run by internal MCU) of the device. Usually, patches are  used to fixes bugs or add improvements and new features of the firmware installed in the internal ROM of the device. Patches to the SI473X are distributed in binary form and have to be transferred to the internal RAM of the device by the host MCU (in this case Arduino boards). Since the RAM is volatile memory, the patch stored into the device gets lost when you turn the system off. Consequently, the content of the patch has to be transferred again to the device each time after turn the system on or reset the device.

I would like to thank [Mr Vadim Afonkin](https://youtu.be/fgjPGnTAVgM) for making available the SSBRX patches for
SI4735-D60 on his [Dropbox repository](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/xzofrl8rfaaqh59/AAA5au2_CVdi50NBtt0IivyIa?dl=0). On this repository you have two files, __amrx_6_0_1_ssbrx_patch_full_0x9D29.csg__ and __amrx_6_0_1_ssbrx_patch_init_0xA902.csg__.  It is important to know that the patch content of the original files is constant hexadecimal representation used by the language C/C++. Actally, the original files are in ASCII format (not in binary format).  If you are not using C/C++ or if you want to load the files directly to the SI4735-D60 or SI4732-A10, you must convert the values to numeric value of the hexadecimal constants. 

##### For example: 

| Hexadecimal C/C++ constant | Binary representation | Decimal representation | 
| -------------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------- | 
| 0x15                       | 00010101              |  21                    |
| 0x01                       | 00000001              |   1                    |
| 0xFF                       | 11111111              | 255                    |



__ATTENTION__:
The author of this project does not guarantee that procedures shown here will work in your development environment. Given this, it is at your own risk to continue with the procedures suggested here. __This library works with the I²C communication protocol and it is designed to apply a SSB extension PATCH to CI SI4735-D60 or SI4732-A10__. Once again, the author disclaims any liability for any damage this procedure may cause to your SI4735 or other devices that you are using.

All methods/functions to deal with SSB on Si4735-D60 can be seen [here](https://pu2clr.github.io/SI4735/extras/apidoc/html/group__group17.html).

### EEPROM support

Depending on your MCU memory size, to use SSB mode may not be possible due to the large amount of memory required by the patch. To solve this problem this library implemented the function __downloadPatchFromEeprom__. This function reads the patch content from an external EEPROM and transfer it to the SI4732-A10 or SI4735-D60 devices. To run this function you must have a external I2C EEPROM device well configured with your MCU and the Si4732/35 device on I²C bus. Also, the EEPROM must have the patch content generated by the sketch  SI47XX_09_SAVE_SSB_PATCH_EEPROM stored in it. [See folder TOOLS](https://github.com/pu2clr/SI4735/tree/master/examples/TOOLS/SI47XX_09_SAVE_SSB_PATCH_EEPROM).

The example [SI4735_06_SSB_EEPROM](https://github.com/pu2clr/SI4735/tree/master/examples/SI47XX_01_SERIAL_MONITOR/SI4735_06_SSB_EEPROM) shows this functionality on an Arduino Pro Mini. 

The example [SI47XX_03_SSB_Tiny4kOLED](https://github.com/pu2clr/SI4735/tree/master/examples/SI47XX_05_ATTINY85/SI47XX_03_SSB_Tiny4kOLED) implements this functionality on an ATtiny85.

To store the SSB patch content into an EEPROM, [See sketch SI47XX_09_SAVE_SSB_PATCH_EEPROM](https://github.com/pu2clr/SI4735/tree/master/examples/TOOLS/SI47XX_09_SAVE_SSB_PATCH_EEPROM). 

__Attention__: The full ssb patch needs about 16KB on eeprom.  __All data that you have stored before into your eeprom device will be lost after the execution of the sketch SI47XX_09_SAVE_SSB_PATCH_EEPROM__.  

__The EEPROM device used for testing was the AT24C256 Serial I²C Interface__

#### SAVING RECEIVER STATUS INTO THE INTERNAL EEPROM

You also can store useful data without a special circuit. This approach will store data every time some important status changes. The idea is store data only if it is necessary.

Steps: 

* Select the data you want to keep into the EEPROM;
* Add the code to monitor the data in your sketch;
* Add code to save the data. In this case, you need to define the criteria that will be used to perform a recording on the EEPROM. In general, a good criteria is:  any change of useful data AND elapsed time. It will depend on your application.   
* Consider using the method EEPROM.update instead EEPROM.write. It will not write information if it is the same stored before;
* Add the code to restore data from EEPROM;
* Add the code to check if exist useful data stored into EEPROM. It can be a single byte indicating that exist valid information for the system. Use an identification number (ID) that will be understood as valid data by the system.  
* Add code to erase the information in EEPROM. All you have to do is erasing the identification number. Actually just change the ID value. In other words, you do not need erease all data stored into EEPROM to reset the data to the system.
* Add code to RESET the system. At system start up check if a given button is pressed and then erase the ID;


#### Example

```cpp

#define STORE_TIME 10000      // Time of inactivity to make the current receiver status writable (10 seconds).

const uint8_t app_id = 35;     // Application ID. Any value from 1 to 255.  It will be useful to check the EEPROM content before processing useful data
const int eeprom_address = 0;  // Address where the data will be stored into EEPROM
long storeTime = millis();     // elapsed time control 


void setup() {

  .
  .
  .

  // If you want to reset the eeprom, keep the  button pressed during statup
  if (digitalRead(GIVEN_BUTTON) == LOW)
  {
    EEPROM.write(eeprom_address, 0); // Changes the application ID. It invalidates all stotred information. 
    delay(2000);
  }

  .
  .
  .

  // Checking the EEPROM content and read if it has valid information
  if (EEPROM.read(eeprom_address) == app_id)
  {
    readAllReceiverInformation();
  }

  .
  .
  .

}


void saveAllReceiverInformation()
{
  EEPROM.update(eeprom_address, app_id);                      // stores the app id;
  EEPROM.update(eeprom_address + 1, si4735.getVolume());      // stores the current Volume
  EEPROM.update(eeprom_address + 2, currentMode);             // Stores the current Mode (FM / AM / SSB)
  EEPROM.update(eeprom_address + 3, currentFrequency >> 8);   // Store the current frequency
  EEPROM.update(eeprom_address + 4, currentFrequency & 0XFF);
  .
  .
  .
  
}


void readAllReceiverInformation()
{
  volume = EEPROM.read(eeprom_address + 1);                 // Gets the stored volume;
  currentMode = EEPROM.read(eeprom_address + 2);            // Gets the stored mode
  currentFrequency = EEPROM.read(eeprom_address + 3) << 8;  // Gets the stored frequency 
  currentFrequency |= EEPROM.read(eeprom_address + 4);
  .
  .
  .
}


void loop() {
  .
  .
  .
  // Monitor your data and set statusChanged variable to true if any useful data has changed. 
  .
  .
  .
  
  // check if some status was changed  
  if ( statusChanged )
  {
    // If the status has changed and the elapsed time is less than minimal time, wait a bit more for saving new data. 
    if ((millis() - storeTime) > STORE_TIME) 
    {
      saveAllReceiverInformation();
      storeTime = millis();
      statusChanged = false;
    }
  }
   
}

```

See this aproach working on [SI47XX_03_ALL_IN_ONE_NEW_INTERFACE_V2](https://github.com/pu2clr/SI4735/tree/master/examples/SI47XX_03_OLED_I2C/SI47XX_03_ALL_IN_ONE_NEW_INTERFACE_V20)




### Digital Audio support 

First of all, it is important to say that passive Crystal and digital audio mode cannot be used at the same time on SI47XX devices. The document Si47XX ANTENNA, SCHEMATIC, LAYOUT, AND DESIGN GUIDELINES; AN383; rev 0.8; page 6; you will find the following note: "Crystal and digital audio mode cannot be used at the same time".  So, for Digital Audio, you have to remove the crystal, and capacitors connected to the crystal from the circuit. 

This library supports the external clock reference and has implemented the digital audio functions. 
You can configure digital audio and external clock reference by using the functions: __setup, radioPowerUp, digitalOutputFormat, digitalOutputSampleRate, setRefClock and setRefClockPrescaler__. 

See the [API Documentation](https://pu2clr.github.io/SI4735/extras/apidoc/html/) for more details.

### Customizing PU2CLR Arduino Library

Maybe you need some Si47XX device functions that the __PU2CLR SI4735 Arduino Library__ has not implemented so far. Also, you may want to change some existent function behaviors. This topic describes some approaches to add new SI473X features to your application.


__Please, check the [API documentation](https://pu2clr.github.io/SI4735/extras/apidoc/html/) before implementing something you think is new. It is possible that what you want has already been implemented__. 

####  Primitive Functions
This library has primitive functions that make it easier for you to implement commands that may not have been implemented yet. The methods [setProperty, getProperty sendCommand, getCommandResponse and getStatusResponse](https://pu2clr.github.io/SI4735/extras/apidoc/html/group__group10.html) can be used to setup the SI473X devices directely. They can also be useful to check some features of the SI473X devices. To use those methods you have to be guided by the ["AN332 Si47XX PROGRAMMING GUIDE REV 1.0"](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/application-notes/AN332.pdf) and __AN332 REV 0.8 UNIVERSAL PROGRAMMING GUIDE AMENDMENT FOR SI4735-D60 SSB AND NBFM PATCHES__ Silicon Labs documentation.  If you are familiar with bit operators in C / C ++, you will have no problem in using the above functions. 

The example below configures the GPIO by sending the 0x81 (GPIO_SET) command(AN332 Si47XX Programming guide page 195). 

```cpp

SI4735 rx;
uint8_t args[] = {0b00001010} // will set the GPIO 1 and 3 to high
uint8_t response[0]

.
.
.

rx.sendCommand(0x81,1,args);
.
.
rs.getCommandResponse(1,response);
.
.
.

```

#### Extending the SI4735 class

The best way to customize the PU2CLR SI4735 Arduino Library for your needs is extending the current version of the library by using C++ OOP approaching.  For example: 

```cpp
#include <SI4735.h>
class MyCustomSI4735 : public SI4735 { // extending the original class SI4735
  public:
    // New functions / methods
    int methodA() {    // some SI47XX command that PU2CLR SI4735 Arduino Library does not implement
      return 0;
    }

    int methodB() {    // another SI47XX command that PU2CLR SI4735 Arduino Library does not implement
      return 1;
    }

    // Overwriting existent methods
    void setTuneFrequencyAntennaCapacitor(uint16_t capacitor) { 
      // Here, your setTuneFrequencyAntennaCapacitor code that will replace the original code 
      // Tip: currentFrequencyParams is a protected member of SI4735 class and can be referred in your code
      currentFrequencyParams.arg.ANTCAPH = 0;         // it is just an example 
      currentFrequencyParams.arg.ANTCAPL = capacitor; // it is just an example 
      return;
    }

    void reset() {
      /// your reset code that will replace the original reset code 
      pinMode(resetPin, OUTPUT);
      delay(1);
      digitalWrite(resetPin, LOW);
      delay(50);
      digitalWrite(resetPin, HIGH);
    }
};

MyCustomSI4735 radio; // the instance of your custom class based on SI4735 class

void setup()
{
  Serial.begin(9600);
  while (!Serial);
  Serial.println("Customizing Si4735 class example.");
  radio.setup(12, 0); // Arduino pin 12 as reset and FM mode (0)
  radio.setFM(8400, 10800, 10390, 10); 
  // Setting the tune capacitor with your code instead Si4735 library code.
  radio.setTuneFrequencyAntennaCapacitor(100);
  // Calling new functions implemented by you.
  Serial.println(radio.methodA());
  Serial.println(radio.methodB());
}

void loop() {
  // Your code with your custom SI4734 library.
}
```

If you use that approach, all you have to do is download the current version of PU2CLR SI4735 Arduino Library. Instead of using PU2CLR SI4735 Arduino Library class directly, you can use your own class that extends the original class.  This way, you always have the current version of the library customized for your needs. So, no extra work will be needed when you update the PU2CLR SI4735 Arduino Library. In other words, your custom code will be always synchronized with the PU2CLR SI4735 Arduino Library code.


__Please, check the [API documentation](https://pu2clr.github.io/SI4735/extras/apidoc/html/) before implementing something you think is new. It is possible that what you want has already been implemented__.

### Schematic

The main purpose of this prototype is to test the Si4735 Arduino Library. It does not intend to be a real radio for exigent listeners. However, it is possible to start with it and then, if you wish, you can include some devices to the circuit to improve, for example,  its sensibility beyond other desired features.
[Click here to see a complete set of schematics and tips](https://pu2clr.github.io/SI4735/extras/schematic)

The image below shows a version of Silicon Labs SSOP Typical Application Schematic connect to the host MCU (Arduino Pro Mini 3.3V). __Pay attention to the Si4735-D60 SEN pin (16).  When the SEN pin is connected to the ground, the I²C bus address is 0x11. When the SEN pin is connected to +3.3V, the I²C bus address is 0x63.  By default, the "Si4735 Arduino Library" uses the 0x11 I²C bus address (SEN pin connected to GND). If you want to use the address 0x63 (SEN connected on +3.3V), see the functions (methods) getDeviceI2CAddress, setDeviceI2CAddress and setDeviceOtherI2CAddress__.

  * *2: R4 and R5 are pull-up resistor included by the author of this project. They are not present on original Silicon Labs schematic.  This will also depend on other devices connected to the same I²C bus.  __Always try to use the lowest possible value__.

__Notes from Silicon Labs Broadcast AM/FM/SW/LW Radio Receiver documentation (page 12)__:
* Place C1 close to VA and C4 close to VD pin.
* All grounds connect directly to GND plane on PCB.
* Pins 6 and 7 are no connects, leave floating.
* Pins 10 and 11 are unused. Tie these pins to GND.
* To ensure proper operation and receiver performance, follow the guidelines in “AN383: Si47xx Antenna, Schematic,
* Layout, and Design Guidelines.” Silicon Laboratories will evaluate schematics and layouts for qualified customers.
* Pin 8 connects to the FM antenna interface, and pin 12 connects to the AM antenna interface.
* Place Si473x-D60 as close as possible to antenna and keep the FMI and AMI traces as short as possible.

### Tips to build 

* Try to follow what the Silicon Labs recommends; 
* Start building the minimum circuit and test it;
* Check if the Si47XX RESET pin (15 on SSOP version or 5 on QFN version) is connected on  your MCU (Arduino) pin defined as RESET the (the most of schematics and examples of this project this pin is the digital pin 12);
* Use the minimum sketch to test the minimum circuit. The first three examples of this project (see  examples folder) can be used to test the minimum circuit; 
* Try not improvising the I²C bus connection. Start using a 3.3V MCU (Arduino Pro Mini 8MHz or DUE,  ESP32 or other 3.3V device) to connect with SI4735;
* If you are using the __Arduino Pro Mini__ 3.3V board, select the correct __Processor__ on Arduino IDE (ATmega328, 3.3V, 8MHz); 
* Some devices provide internal pull-up resistors that in some cases can be enabled or disabled. Also, the capacitance of the I²C bus is another variable that have be considered to select the right resistor values. However, that capacitance is not easy to be measured. For these reasons, it can be a liitle dificult calculate the right resitor values at first. That said, start with a high pullup resistor to I²C bus and then reduce it until the best value. For example: start with 10K and try to reduce the value to 4,7K, 3,3K, 2.2K etc. Select the lowest resistor you can.
* I²C bus devices are available in different speeds. If you are using an I²C display device, check if its speed is compatible with the Si47XX and also with the current speed used by the master MCU;
* Using different voltage levels between I²C devices can be unsafe and can destroy parts connected on I²C bus, specially the Si47XX;
* It is important to wire all your I²C devices on the same common ground. 
* If you are using Arduino Mini Pro, UNO or similar, pay attention to the pin 13 and the use of internal pull-up resistor. This pin has a LED and a resistor connected on the board. When this pin is set to HIGH, the LED comes on. If you use the internal pull-up resistor of the pin 13, you might experiment problem due to the drop voltage caused by the LED circuit. If this occurs in your project, you can do: 
  *  Use the pin 14. This pin is the A0 (Analog). But you have to refer it by 14 to use it as digital pin; 
  *  Change the circuit and sketch to use external pull-up on pin 13;
  *  Remove the LED or resitor connected to the led from the board.   
* Use only batteries to power your circuit. Receptions in LW, MW and SW can be seriously harmed by the use of power supplies connected to the grid. 
* See some Shortwave antenna configuration on [Si47XX ANTENNA, SCHEMATIC, LAYOUT, AND DESIGN GUIDELINES; AN383](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/application-notes/AN383.pdf)

## Most Frequent Problems

### The system does not start.

Depending on your setup, the system can hang at the beginning. 

It has been observed in several tests. Some tips:

1. Avoid using the computer connected to the mains during testing. The electrical grid can disturb the communication between the Arduino based board and the SI47XX device;
2. The RESET pin is not configured properly. Check the connection of the SI47XX pin 15 (RST) and the Arduino based board;
3. Try to use a 22K pull-up on Arduino Board pin used for reseting (RESET PIN). It may be needed if you are using some Arduino based boards like (Atmega32, Atmega128 etc)
4. If the SI47XX pin 16 (SEN) is grounded, the I²C bus address must be 0x11, otherwise it must be 0x63 (the default I2C bus address is 0x11). Preferably, keep this pin grounded;
5. Check if the pins 17 (SCLK / SCL) and 18 (SDIO / SDA) of the SI47XX device are correctly connected to the Arduino board pins;
6. Check the pull-up resistors connected to the pins 17 (SCLK / SCL) and 18 (SDIO / SDA) of the SI47XX device;
7. Check the voltage on SI47XX pin 15 (RST).  It should be 3.3V. All digital pins of your Arduino must have 3.3v when in HIGH condition. If it is greater than 3.3V, probably you are using an 5V board; 
8. If you are using the board Arduino Pro Mini 3.3V (8MHz), be sure you selected the correct board on Arduino IDE Tools menu, Processor: __"Atmega328P (3.3V, 8MHz)"__. By default, the Arduino IDE uses the 5V processor version; 
9. Do not try to power an ATmega328 Arduino Board designed to work with 5V and 16MHz with a 3.3V supply. That configuration will make your system unstable. See [ATmega328P Datasheet](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/Atmel-7810-Automotive-Microcontrollers-ATmega328P_Datasheet.pdf);  
10. Do not try to power your Arduino based board designed to work with 3.3V with greater voltage. See the technical specifications of your Arduino Board and remember that the maximum voltage of the SI47XX MCU CONTROL INTERFACE is 3.6V;
11. Check the external crystal and its capacitors connections. 

__Attention__: The pins numbers above is considering Si473x-D60(SSOP) package.



### On FM mode, the receiver jump from a station to another station without any action.

If you are using Arduino Mini Pro, UNO or similar, pay attention to the pin 13 and the use of internal pull-up resistor. This pin has a LED and a resistor connected on the board. When this pin is set to HIGH, the LED comes on. If you use the internal pull-up resistor of the pin 13, you might experiment problem due to the drop voltage caused by the LED circuit. If this occurs in your project, do one of the following:
  *  Use the pin 14 instead. This pin is the A0 (Analog). But you have to refer it by 14 to use it as digital pin; 
  *  Change the circuit and sketch to use external pull-up on pin 13; or
  *  Remove the LED or the resitor connected to the LED from the Arduino Board.   

### After power up or try to tune the receiver, the display shows LW and 0 kHz

This problem can be a little complicated to solve. It can occur in many situations. I have observed that very few times in my experiments: 
 
* When I am powering the system using the computer USB and the computer is connected to the grid, it might occur. __Please, test your system using only batteries__.
* If you are using the board Arduino Pro Mini 3.3V (8MHz), be sure you have selected the correct board on the IDE Tools menu, Processor: __"Atmega328P (3.3V, 8MHz)"__. By default, the Arduino IDE uses the 5V processor version.
* Check if the RESET pin of the SI473X and the controller are well connected.  
* This problem also can be caused by the external crystal connected to the SI473X device (in general 32768K). This crystal needs a minimum delay to become stable after a reset or power up command. Currently, this delay is 10ms. Try to increase that delay by using the method setMaxDelayPowerUp.

__Example:__

```cpp
void setup() {
 
 si4735.setMaxDelayPowerUp(500); // now the delay after power up will be 500 ms
 si4735.setup(RESET_PIN, FM_FUNCTION);

}
```


* Also, for some reason, the frequency switching needs a little delay (the default value is 30ms).  Try to increase that delay by using the method setMaxDelaySetFrequency.</P>

__Example:__

```cpp
void setup() {
  si4735.setMaxDelaySetFrequency(50);
  si4735.setup(RESET_PIN, FM_FUNCTION);
}
```

* __Finally, if no previous attempt could not solve the issue, check that the crystal is working correctly__.


### I cannot tune satisfactorily any station on LW, MW or SW

* Please, use only batteries to power your system up on LW, MW or SW; 
* Check your circuit on AMI pin of the Si47XX device;
* Keep as far as possible from noise sources (LED light bulb, computers and any device connected to the power grid);
* Try to find a suitable size for the antenna wire. Too long can be a big noise pickup. If too short, it may not be enough to pick up radio stations.
 

### When the receiver starts or when I switches it from FM to AM and vice-versa, I have loud click in the speaker  

Some users may be uncomfortable with the loud popping of the speaker during some transitions caused by some Si47XX device commands. This problem occurs during the receiver transition from the power down to power up internal commands. Also, every time the user changes the mode (FM to AM or AM to FM) the sequence power down and power up internal commands is required by the Si47XX devices. 

The SI473X devices have HIGH DC (DC bias) component in the analog audio output pins (SI4735-D60 pins 23 and 24). When the device goes to power down mode, the voltage on the audio pins drops to 0V.  The device do it internally and there is not a way to avoid that. When the device goes to power up, that audio pins suddenly goes to the  HIGH DC again. This transition causes the loud pop in the speaker. So far, the author of this library have not found an internal solution to solve the loud popping of the speaker. It is important to say that internal SI473X mute or volume commands will not work for this purpose. However, it is possible to solve this problem by adding an extra __mute__ circuit and control it by the MCU (Atmega, ESP32, STM32, ATtiny85 etc). 

The schematic below shows this approach.

<BR>

![Mute circuit](extras/images/schematic_mute_circuit_eagle.png)

Considering that you are using a MCU based on Atmega328, when the D14 (A0) is HIGH the Si47XX output audio will be drained to the ground. At this condition, no audio will be transferred to the amplifier input and, consequently, to the speaker. So, no loud click in the speaker. 

When the D14 is LOW, the most of signal audio output from the Si47XX will be transfered to the input of the amplifier. 

The code below shows all you have to do in your sketch to implement this resource.


```cpp

#include <SI4735.h>
#define AUDIO_MUTE 14      // Pin A0 - Switch AGC ON/OF

Si4735 r;

void setup() {
  .
  
  // It is all you have to do to control a external audio mute circuit if you have one. 
  r.setAudioMuteMcuPin(AUDIO_MUTE); // Tells the system to control an external audio mute circuit. 

  r.setup(RESET_PIN, -1, 1, SI473X_ANALOG_AUDIO); // Starts on FM mode and ANALOG audio mode. 
  .
  .
  .

} 
```

{% include audiomute.html %}


Some low power audio amplifiers IC also implement mute circuit that can be controlled externally. You can find this resource on __[LM4906](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm4906.pdf), [LM4863](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm4863.pdf?ts=1588602798363), KA8602B, MC34119, PAM8403__ and __HT82V739__ devices.

## Saving Memory on ATmega328 applications

* Use [MiniCore](https://github.com/MCUdude/MiniCore) board setup instead regular Arduino Atmega328 setup. You can save about 1KB by removing the bootloader and using LTO option;
* You can also use the regular Arduino setup and use the hex file without bootloader (use xloader application in this case);
* Do not use the String class, sprintf or dtostrf functions to format numbers. Use itoa function or your own implementation to convert number to char array. You can save about 2KB.  See example below.

```cpp
/**
  Converts a number to a char string and places leading zeros. 
  It is useful to mitigate memory space used by sprintf or generic similar function
*/
void convertToChar(uint16_t value, char *strValue, uint8_t len)
{
  char d;
  for (int i = (len - 1); i >= 0; i--)
  {
    d = value % 10;
    value = value / 10;
    strValue[i] = d + 48;
  }
  strValue[len] = '\0';
}
```

__TIP:__ The SI4735 Arduino Library has a function to format numeric values like frequency, bfo, rssi etc. See [convertToChar documentation](https://pu2clr.github.io/SI4735/extras/apidoc/html/group__group18.html#ga133ec11bfc2c68100b47a63da4484767)


Example:

```cpp
.
.
.
void showFrequency()
{
  char freqDisplay[10];

  if (band[bandIdx].bandType == FM_BAND_TYPE)
  {
    rx.convertToChar(currentFrequency, freqDisplay, 5, 3, ','); // Formats the FM frequency
  }
  else
  {
    if (band[bandIdx].bandType == MW_BAND_TYPE || band[bandIdx].bandType == LW_BAND_TYPE)
      rx.convertToChar(currentFrequency, freqDisplay, 5, 0, '.'); // Formats LW and MW frequency
    else
      rx.convertToChar(currentFrequency, freqDisplay, 5, 2, '.'); // Formats SW frequency
  }
  showValue(0, 0, oldFrequency, freqDisplay, 2, 11);
}
.
.
.

```

* Regarding SSB patch, use the __patch_ssb_compressed.h__ and [downloadCompressedPatch](https://pu2clr.github.io/SI4735/extras/apidoc/html/group__group17.html#gaf1b8947db928728ada66ef3edaa79e76) intead __init.h__ and [downloadPatch](https://pu2clr.github.io/SI4735/extras/apidoc/html/group__group17.html#gafd1343bd8b4f0c290ef81c418222036c).   

```cpp 

#include "patch_ssb_compressed.h" // SSB patch for whole SSBRX initialization string

const uint16_t size_content = sizeof ssb_patch_content; // See ssb_patch_content.h
const uint16_t cmd_0x15_size = sizeof cmd_0x15;         // Array of lines where the 0x15 command occurs in the patch content.



void loadSSB()
{
  .
  .
  rx.setI2CFastModeCustom(500000);
  rx.queryLibraryId(); // Is it really necessary here? I will check it.
  rx.patchPowerUp();
  delay(50);
  rx.downloadCompressedPatch(ssb_patch_content, size_content, cmd_0x15, cmd_0x15_size);
  rx.setSSBConfig(bandwidthSSB[bwIdxSSB].idx, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1);
  rx.setI2CStandardMode();
  .
  .

}
```

* [ˆ4] It seams that in some ESP32 board, the I²C bus is not configured prorpelly by default. However, you can set almost any pin on ESP32 to setup I²C capabilities. All you have to do is call __Wire.begin(SDA, SCL);__ where SDA and SCL are the ESP32 GPIO pins. See see the folder examples to check how to use ESP32 devices. 
* [^5] You can use the pin 12 too.

*1 -  __Acording to Silicon Labs guide AN332, the SI4732-A10 has the same firmware FMRX component and AM_SW_LW RX component as that of SI4735-D60. See Si47XX PROGRAMMING GUIDE; AN332; page 2. So, like the SI4735-D60, it is possible to use it to listen to SSB mode with the SI4732-A10__.

*2 - Although the SI4730-D60 does not officially support SW, several tests performed during the development of this library, as well as tests performed by other experimenters, it was observed excellent performance of this IC on HF/SW band. See "Si47XX PROGRAMMING GUIDE; pages 2 and 3; Table 1 - Product Family Function" for more details. See the video [Si4730-D60 ultimate testing (FM/RDS + LW + SW)](https://youtu.be/lRYE854EOrk). __It is important to note that the author of this library does not guarantee all SI4730-D60 devices sold on the market will work in LW and SW bands and FM with RDS as well__.

#### Protoboard

The basic circuit built on protoboard is based on the “__SSOP Typical Application Schematic__”, suggested by the Silicon Labs Documentation (Si4730/31/34/35-D60-BROADCAST AM/FM/SW/LW RADIO RECEIVER; page 19). Two pull-up 4.7K resistors were added on I²C bus (It is an arbitrary value. Actually, this value may vary depending on your devices connected to the bus). Also, it is recomended to add two 4.7uF capacitors between the CI audio output  and audio amplifier. The photos below do not show these capacitors. See  [C7 and C8 on schematic](https://pu2clr.github.io/SI4735/#schematic).

<BR>

The figure below shows a suggestion to shrink the prototype and connections. If you are just doing prototyping, I recommend this approach due to the short connections with the Si4735 (recommended by the manufacturer).

![Mini Protoboard 01](./extras/images/SI4735_mini_protoboard_01.png)

<BR>

The configuration above connected to Arduino Pro Mini is shown below. 


![Mini Protoboard 02](./extras/images/SI4735_mini_protoboard_02.png)


<BR>


The following photo shows the most common prototyping approach. Use this approach if you don't want to solder the components on the adapter plate.

![Protoboard 01](./extras/images/protoboard_01.png)

The figure above shows the very basic shematic implementation (no Button or Encoder). See the folder [examples](./examples) for more details and other configuration with LCD and OLED

* [Android and iOS Bluetooth Remote Control for PU2CLR Arduino Library DSP receivers](https://pu2clr.github.io/bluetooth_remote_control/). This project is an extension of the Arduino library projects for: [SI4735](https://pu2clr.github.io/SI4735/); [AKC6959](https://pu2clr.github.io/AKC695X/) and [KT0915](https://pu2clr.github.io/KT0915/). It is a simple example that shows a way to use your smartphone as a remote control via Bluetooth. In order to follow the steps presented here, I am assuming that you have some knowledge in development for mobile devices. Also, you will need to be familiar with the Javascript programming language. The development environment used by this project is the [Apache Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/overview/index.html). Cordova is a open-source mobile development framework that allows you to develop cross-platform applications. That means you can code once and deploy the application in many system, including iOS and Android. 
Cordova provides an easy way to develop for iOS and Android.
